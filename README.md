# Price-Prediction
The Car Price Prediction project is designed to predict the prices of cars based on various relevant factors. The main objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately estimate the market value of a car, empowering both car buyers and sellers to make more informed decisions.

The project utilizes a linear regression model to analyze and process the data. The dataset contains information on different car features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and more. By training the model on this data, it learns the relationships between these features and car prices, enabling it to predict the price of a car given its characteristics.
